# dashboard-control-switcher
Dashboard-Control-Switcher is a full-spectrum Industrial IoT & Automation Dashboard designed as a central hub for control, parameter visualization, and cross-platform system integration. It enables engineers to switch between multiple control methods (PID, fuzzy logic, AI-driven, etc.) while bridging connectivity between industrial PLCs and microcontrollers via standard protocols (Modbus, MQTT, OPC-UA). Powered by a Large Language Model (LLM), raw sensor data, logs, and system states are transformed into human-readable insights, improving readability, maintainability, and decision-making. Beyond real-time monitoring, the system also features predictive maintenance intelligence, enabling early anomaly detection and maximizing uptime in the context of smart factories and Industry 4.0 automation.
